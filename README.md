# Dice-roll-game
Udemy Course for JavaScript - Dice Roll Game
How the game works:
Players take turns rolling the dice.
The points a player gets is equivalent to the number of the dice roll ex 5 roll on the dice is 5 points.
Players can choose to roll again on their turn to gather more points.
Players can roll again or hold their points on their turn.
a new players turn begins when a player chooses to hold their points or If the dice roll is 1 the player loses all current points gathered in the round.
The game continues until one player reaches a total of 50 points.
